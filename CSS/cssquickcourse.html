    Maharashtra  MH or Maha is a state in the western peninsular region of India occupying a substantial <br>
 portion of the Deccan Plateau. Maharashtra is the second-most populous state in India and the <br>
 second-most populous country.<br>
 subdivision globally. It was formed on 1 May 1960 by splitting the bilingual Bombay State,<br>
  which had existed since 1956, into majority Marathi-speaking Maharashtra and Gujarati-speaking Gujarat.<br>
 Maharashtra is home to the Marathi people, the predominant ethno-linguistic group, who speak the Marathi<br>
 language, the official language of the state. The state is divided into 6 divisions and 36 districts, <br>
 with the state capital being Mumbai, the most populous urban area in India, and Nagpur serving as the<br>
 winter capital, which also hosts the winter session of the state legislature.<br>
 Godavari and Krishna are the two major rivers in the state. Forests cover 16.47 per cent of the state's<br> 
 geographical area. Out of the total cultivable land in the state, about 60 per cent is used for grain crops<br>
 in the Deccan region, rice in coastal Konkan, and other high rainfall areas.<br>
 Spread over 307,713 km2 (118,809 sq mi), Maharashtra is the third-largest state by area in India.<br>
It is bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west, the Indian states of Karnataka and Goa to the south,<br>
 Telangana to the southeast and Chhattisgarh to the east, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh to the north,<br>
 and the Indian union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to the northwest.<br>
 The state has three international airports, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (Mumbai),<br>
 Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport (Nagpur), and Pune Airport. The state is home to three railways<br>
  headquarters viz. Central Railway (Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus), Konkan Railway (CBD Belapur),<br>
and Western Railway (Churchgate). The High Court of the state viz. Bombay High Court is located in Mumbai.<br>
The state contributes 48 seats and 19 seats to the lower house Lok Sabha and the upper house Rajya Sabha,<br>
 respectively. Maharashtra has been subject to President's rule three times since its formation <br>
for a total of 156 days for different reasons. More than three-fourths of the population practice Hinduism,<br>
which is followed by Islam and Buddhism. The state is home to four UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Ajanta, Ellora <br>
and Elephanta caves, and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus).<br>

Maharashtra is one of the most industrialised states in India. The state's capital, Mumbai is India's<br>
 financial and commercial capital.[12] India's largest stock exchange Bombay Stock Exchange, <br>
 the oldest in Asia<br>
 is located in the city. The state has played a significant role in the country's social and political life<br> 
 and is widely considered a leader in terms of agricultural and industrial production, trade and transport, <br>
 and education.[13] Maharashtra is among the most developed Indian states and continues to be the single <br>
 largest contributor to the national economy with a share of 14 per cent in all-India nominal GDP.<br>
 The economy of Maharashtra is the largest in India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of ₹35.81<br>
 trillion (US$450 billion) and GSDP per capita of ₹225,073 (US$2,800).[15] The service sector dominates <br>
 state's economy, accounting for 69.3 per cent of the value of the output of the country. Although <br>
 agriculture accounts for 12 per cent of the state GDP, it employs nearly half the population of the state.<br>
 Maharashtra is the fifteenth-highest ranking among Indian states in the human development index.<br>

The region that encompasses the state has a history going back many millennia.<br>
Prior to Indian independence, notable dynasties and entities that ruled the region include <br>
in a chronologial order, the Maurya, the Western Satraps, the Satavahana dynasty, Rashtrakuta dynasty,<br>
Western Chalukyas, the Bahamanis, Deccan sultanates, Mughals, the Maratha Empire founded by Shivaji, <br>
and the British. Ruins, monuments, tombs, forts, and places of worship left by these rulers are dotted<br>
around the state. At the time of the Indian independence movement in the early 20th century, <br>
along with British ruled areas of Bombay presidency, and Central Provinces and Berar, the region included<br>
many British Vassal states. Among these, the erstwhile Hyderabad state was the largest and extended over<br>
 many modern Indian states. Other states grouped under Deccan States Agency included Kolhapur, Miraj,<br>
 Sangli, Aundh, Bhor, and Sawantwadi.<br>
